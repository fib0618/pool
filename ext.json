This Staking service was built for my daughter with the hope that one day she will be able to be a Stake Pool operator and carry the legacy of the Power Stake Pool. As a family, we are strong believers and supporters of the Cardano philosophy, and my daughter was named Ada in honor of Ada Lovelace and the Cardano Blockchain. Thank you for staking with us. We are committed to keeping the Variable fee as long as possible. ",
